# Advent of Code 2021!

My attempts at advent of code 2021 https://adventofcode.com/

This was my first time doing AOC and it was a lot of fun! I didn't solve every problem but definitely learned a lot about crunching big numbers and using algorithms for problems where brute force would that weeks to run. Exam season ramped up later on and I fell off on the latter half of the challenge :(.
